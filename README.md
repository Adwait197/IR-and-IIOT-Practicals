# IR-and-IIOT-Practicals
Explore a series of projects showcasing innovative applications in Information Retrieval and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Leveraging Python for robust backend development and Raspberry Pi for edge computing, these projects demonstrate practical solutions in data retrieval, analysis, and industrial automation.

1) Explore a collection of projects in the field of Information Retrieval (IR), demonstrating the application of search and retrieval techniques to efficiently access and retrieve information from large datasets. These projects cover various aspects of IR, including document indexing, query processing, and relevance ranking.

Projects:

Inverted Index Construction:
Description: Implemented an inverted index construction system, enabling fast and efficient retrieval of documents based on query terms.
Key Features: Python-based implementation, optimization for large-scale document collections.
Vector Space Model for Document Retrieval:
Description: Developed a vector space model for document retrieval, allowing users to query a collection of documents and receive ranked results based on similarity.
Key Features: Term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) weighting, cosine similarity calculation.
Web Search Engine Prototype:
Description: Built a simple web search engine prototype that crawls and indexes web pages, providing users with the ability to search and retrieve relevant information.
Key Features: Web crawling using BeautifulSoup, indexing with inverted index, basic relevance ranking.
